## Smart Meter CII Reader and LoRaWAN Transmitter Overview
This repository contains open-source software for interfacing with a smart meter using the CII push protocol over a wired M-BUS adapter. The software decodes the smart meter data and transmits it using a RAK WisBlock LoRaWAN module to a designated endpoint for further processing. The software is written in C++ and is compatible with the RAK WisBlock RAK4631. Future updates aim to expand compatibility to include other MCU platforms with WLAN capabilities.

## Features
- Compatible with smart meters using the CII push protocol. Developed and testet with L&G E450
- Uses RAK WisBlock LoRaWAN modules for reliable and long-range data transmission.
- Expandable for other microcontroller units (MCUs) with WLAN support.
- Open to the Community-driven development and support.

## Hardware Requirements
- [RAKwireless WisBlock RAK4631 Core Module](https://docs.rakwireless.com/Product-Categories/WisBlock/RAK4631/Overview)
- [Wired M-BUS adapter (make it yourself)](https://github.com/MFA-Informatik-AG/rak-wisblock-io-mbus) or buy it from [Wired M-BUS adapter shop](https://shop.smartspar.ch/products/wired-m-bus-adapter)
- LoRaWAN Gateway (for data transmission)

## Installation
Please clone the repository to your local machine from

## Setting Up the Development Environment

### Step 1: Install Visual Studio Code (VS Code)
PlatformIO is available as an extension for VS Code, so the first step is to install VS Code, if you haven't already.

#### Download and Install VS Code:
Visit the Visual Studio Code website. Download the appropriate version for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux). Follow the installation instructions specific to your OS.

### Step 2: Install PlatformIO Extension
Once VS Code is installed, you can install the PlatformIO extension.

- Open VS Code.
- Click on the Extensions view icon on the Sidebar.
- Search for the PlatformIO IDE extension.
- Install the the PlatformIO IDE extension.

## Software Overview

### PlatformIO Environments
There are currently environments declared in the platformio.ini

- **wiscore_rak4631** for the RAK4631 board and logging enabled. Don't use this environment for production devices as it requires more power
- **wiscore_rak4631_release** for the RAK4631 board with logging disabled. Use this environment for production devices as it requires the least power
- **wiscore_rak11200** for the RAK11200 board, currently not implementen
- **testnative** some unit tests which can be executed in a PlatformIO Terminal window with *pio test -e testnative -v*

### PlatformIO
The build can be controlled by defines in the platformio.ini settings
**`API_DEBUG`** controls debug output of the WisBlock API

    0 -> No debug output
    1 -> WisBlock API debug output

**`MY_DEBUG`** controls debug output of the application itself

    0 -> No debug output
    1 -> WMB Adapter Application debug output

**`MY_BLE_DEBUG`** controls debug output to Bluetooth

    0 -> No debug output
    1 -> Sends debug messages also to Bluetooth

**`NO_BLE_LED`** controls the usage of the blue BLE LED.    

    0 -> the blue LED will be used to indicate BLE status
    1 -> the blue LED will not used

Example for no debug output and no blue LED
```ini
build_flags = 
	-DAPI_DEBUG=0    ; 0 Disable WisBlock API debug output
	-DMY_DEBUG=0     ; 0 Disable application debug output
	-DNO_BLE_LED=1   ; 1 Disable blue LED as BLE notificator
```
